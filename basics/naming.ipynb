    "## Overview\n",
    "- When writing a program, we often have to give names to many things\n",
    "- Ex: variables, functions, classes, and modules\n",
    "- Thus, it is crucial to learn the rules and conventions\n",
    "    - **Rules** are specifications that we MUST follow\n",
    "    - **Conventions** are more like *suggestions* of best practices by experienced programmers and are widely accepted by the community. Thus, we are not required to follow, but we SHOULD.\n",
    "- For now, we only focus on variable names. Naming for other things is similar"

    "There are 3 rules when naming a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can consist characters from 3 following groups only \n",
    "    - Digits (`0-9`)\n",
    "    - Latin letters (`a-z` and `A-Z`)\n",
    "    - Underscores (`_`)\n",
    "- Cannot start with a digit\n",
    "- Cannot coincide with one of Python's reserved words\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserved words or keywords are words that have special meaning to Python (see the list below)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "False       class       finally     is          return\n",
    "None        continue    for         lambda      try\n",

    "Notes\n",
    "- For now, you don't have to remember all of these keywords. You will remember them as you progress\n",
    "- Python is case-sensitive, meaning that it distinguishes between lowercase and uppercase. Thus, `firstname`, `FirstName`, and `FIRSTNAME` are different"

    "    - Ex: `interest_rate` instead of `r` or `ir`\n",
