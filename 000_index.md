# Introduction

```{note}
This book is unfinished. New content will be updated regularly.
```

This book aims to help you learn the fundamental programming skills with Python. The contents grew out of my experience working as a data analyst/scientist as well as teaching data science to young professionals.

## Audience

This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to program in Python and leverage it to perform analytics tasks.

I assume no prior knowledge in programming or data science. It means that this series is designed for absolute beginners.
