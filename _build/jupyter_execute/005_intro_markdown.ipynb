    "## What is Markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight **markup language** that allows you to add **formatting elements** to plaintext text documents such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headings\n",
    "- Bold, italic\n",
    "- Ordered/unordered lists\n",
    "- Links\n",
    "- Images\n",
    "    \n",
    "Markdown is extremely useful not only for **technical writing** but for any kind of writing in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Versatility**. Markdown can be used for many purposes such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technical documentation (as this tutorial)\n",
    "- Notes and books\n",
    "- Static web pages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal distraction**. Compared to rich-text text processors such as Microsoft Word or Libre Writer, Markdown offers much fewer features. However, this turns out to be its main advantage. By restricting you to a small set of formatting options, Markdown forces you to focus on writing **good content** rather than spending time tweaking the appearances such as themes, fonts, colors, and other kinds of formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portability**. Unlike a Word file (`.docx`), a Markdown file is just a simple plain text file and thus can be opened by any text editors such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code. You won't have to worry when migrating your files to different operating systems or cloud services because you can always access their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy integration**. If you plan to be a data analyst/scientist/researcher, technical documentation is part of your daily work. Markdown makes your life much easier by allowing you to mix your technical notes and executable code in **the same place**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the traditional workflow, you write code to perform some analysis then copy the results (statistics, figures, etc.) into a separate file (normally Word) for reporting purposes. What if the data or some of the requirements change? You have to **re-run your analysis and copy your results again**. This is painful! \n",
    "\n",
    "But by mixing your notes using Markdown with your Python analytics code in a single Jupyter Notebook, all you need to do is to modify the requirements and re-run your notebook. All the results will be automatically updated accordingly. No painful **copy-and-paste** stuff is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy conversion**. You can easily convert a Markdown file to different formats such as PDF and HTML as you can see in the picture below."

    "### Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings are used to organize contents into **sections**. There are 6 levels from `h1` to `h6` with `h1` being the biggest and `h6` being the smallest. Normally, there should be only one `h1` heading in your whole file, which is the title of the document. Other sections will begin with `h2` headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Markdown allows up to 6 levels, you should never use beyond `h3`. Nesting your contents too deep make it hard to follow, thus keep your contents as flat as possible. This is also one of the guiding principles of **Zen of Python** - `Flat is better than nested`. I personally usually use `h1` and `h2` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "A heading starts with `#`. The number of `#` indicates the heading level, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Level 1\n",
    "## Level 2\n",
