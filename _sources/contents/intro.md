# Introduction

```{note}
This book is unfinished. New content will be updated regularly.

This book aims to help you learn the fundamental programming skills with Python. The contents grew out of my experience working as a data analyst/scientist as well as teaching data science to young professionals.

## Audience

This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to program in Python and leverage it to perform analytics tasks.

I assume no prior knowledge in programming or data science. It means that this series is designed for absolute beginners.
