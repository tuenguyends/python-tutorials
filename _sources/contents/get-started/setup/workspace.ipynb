    "# Create a workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "A **workspace** is just a folder/directory on your computer where you host stuff for a given project such as code files, data, output, documentation, etc. The workspace is sometimes called the **root** directory.\n",
    " \n",
    "Often, you will work on multiple projects, so it's best to have a parent folder for them, for example, `D:/ds_projects/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now go inside `D:/ds_projects/` and create a folder named `example/`, then go inside `example/` and create several sub-folders following the structure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "example/\n",
    "    |____ data/\n",
    "    |____ nb/\n",
    "    |____ lib/\n",
    "    |____ out/\n",
    "    |____ docs/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `data/` is for your data files. `nb/` is for your analytics notebooks. `lib/` is for your custom modules. `out/` is for output such as exported Excel files or graphs. `docs/` is for related documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, you only need the `nb/` folder in this tutorial. However, the structure suggested above is a good guideline for you when working on more complex projects in the future."
