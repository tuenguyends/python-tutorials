    "There are three rules when naming a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A name only consists of characters from three groups: digits (`0-9`), letters (`a-z` and `A-Z`), and underscores (`_`)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A name cannot start with a digit\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A name cannot coincide with one of Python's reserved words. Reserved words or keywords are words that have special meaning to Python (see the list below for the complete list)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. For now, you don't have to remember all of these keywords. You will remember them as you progress.\n",

    "- Should be meaningful and easy to remember. Ex: `interest_rate` instead of `r` or `ir`.\n",
    "\n",
