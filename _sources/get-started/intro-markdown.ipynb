    "## What is Markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- Headings\n",
    "- Bold, italic\n",
    "- Ordered/unordered lists\n",
    "- Links\n",
    "- Images\n",
    "    \n",
    "Markdown is extremely useful not only for technical writing but for any kind of writing in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Versatility**. Markdown can be used for many purposes such as\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technical documentation (as this tutorial)\n",
    "- Notes and books\n",
    "- Static web pages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimal distraction**. Compared to rich-text text processors such as Microsoft Word or Libre Writer, Markdown offers much fewer features. However, this turns out to be its main advantage. By restricting you to a small set of formatting options, Markdown forces you to focus on writing good content rather than spending time tweaking the appearances such as themes, fonts, colors, and other kinds of formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Portability**. Unlike a Word file (`.docx`), a Markdown file is just a simple plain text file and thus can be opened by any text editors such as Notepad++, Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code. You won't have to worry when migrating your files to different operating systems or cloud services because you can always access their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy integration**. If you plan to be a data analyst/scientist/researcher, technical documentation is part of your daily work. Markdown makes your life much easier by allowing you to mix your technical notes and executable code in the same place. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy conversion**. You can easily convert a Markdown file to different formats such as PDF and HTML."

    "### Headings\n",
    "\n",
    "Headings are used to organize contents into sections. There are 6 levels from `h1` to `h6` with `h1` being the biggest and `h6` being the smallest. \n",
    "\n",
    "There should be only one `h1` heading in your whole file, which is the title of the document. Other sections will begin with `h2` headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Markdown allows up to 6 levels, you should never use beyond `h3`. Nesting your contents too deep make it hard to follow, thus keep your contents as flat as possible. This is also one of the guiding principles of Zen of Python: \"Flat is better than nested\". I personally usually use `h1` and `h2` only.\n",
    "\n",
    "A heading starts with `#`. The number of `#` indicates the heading level, for example\n",

    "\n",
    "- item 1\n",
    "- item 2\n",
    "- item 3\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an ordered list, place `1.` followed by a space before each item of the list. You don't need to manually increase the number, it will be done automatically. This is very convenient because if you want to insert a new item into the list, you won't have to update the numbers for the items that follow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two types of code fences: inline and block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inline format is used for *short elements* such as a number, a variable name, or an expression. These elements stay in the line with normal texts (thus the name *inline*). To use the inline code format, wrap your code in a pair of single backticks `` ` ``\n",

    "\n",
    "- Numbers: `` `42` `` renders `42`\n",
    "- Variable names: `` `profit` `` renders `profit`\n",
    "- Expressions: `` `y = 3*x + 1` `` renders `y = 3*x + 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the block style is for a block of code, which normally spans more than one line. To use block style, wrap your code in a pair of triple backticks `` ``` ``. You can specify the language to take advantage of syntax highlighting.\n",
