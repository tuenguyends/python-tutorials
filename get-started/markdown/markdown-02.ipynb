    "\n",
    "There should be only one `h1` heading in your whole file, which is the title of the document. Other sections will begin with `h2` headings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Markdown allows up to 6 levels, you should never use beyond `h3`. Nesting your contents too deep make it hard to follow, thus keep your contents as flat as possible. This is also one of the guiding principles of Zen of Python: \"Flat is better than nested\". I personally usually use `h1` and `h2` only.\n",

    "There are two types of code fences: inline and block.\n",

    "The inline format is used for *short elements* such as a number, a variable name, or an expression. These elements stay in the line with normal texts (thus the name *inline*). To use the inline code format, wrap your code in a pair of single backticks `` ` ``\n",

    "- Variable names: `` `profit` `` renders `profit`\n",
    "- Expressions: `` `y = 3*x + 1` `` renders `y = 3*x + 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the block style is for a block of code, which normally spans more than one line. To use block style, wrap your code in a pair of triple backticks `` ``` ``. You can specify the language to take advantage of syntax highlighting.\n",
