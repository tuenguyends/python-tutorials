    "- Being undefined is not the same as being empty. A variable of `list` type can be an empty list, but it still has a type.\n",

    "**Numbers** are used to represent numeric values.\n",

    "- Python implementation: `int` (integers), `float` (real numbers), `complex` (complex numbers), `bool` (truth values).\n",
    "- Note that, in Python `bool` type is a sub-type of `int`. As you will see, `True` and `False` of `bool` is actually `1` and `0` of `int`.\n",

    "- Example `student = {\"name\": \"Rob\", \"age\": 20}`\n",

    "- We access an element of a dictionary using the correspondiong  `key`.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Python implementation: `set`, `frozenset`.\n",
    "- Elements of sets are unique and are not ordered.\n",
    "- There is no way to access an element of a set. We can only check if a value is in a set or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Callable** types are *callable* (you call/invoke a function or a method to do something)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python implementation: `builtin_function_or_method` (functions or methods), `type` (classes)\n",
